io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    // Joining a Chat Room
    socket.on("joinRoom", ({ roomId }) => {
        socket.join(roomId);
    });

    // Sending a Message
    socket.on("sendMessage", ({ roomId, message }) => {
        io.to(roomId).emit("newMessage", { message });
    });
});







In the provided example, I've made the following changes to ensure that messages are sent and received correctly in the chat rooms:

    Joining Rooms:
        On the client side, when a user joins a chat room, they emit a "joinRoom" event with the roomId they want to join.
        On the server side, when the "joinRoom" event is received, the socket joins the specified room using socket.join(roomId).

    Sending Messages:
        When a user sends a message, they emit a "sendMessage" event with the roomId and message content.
        On the server side, when the "sendMessage" event is received, the server emits a "newMessage" event to the specific room using io.to(roomId).emit("newMessage", { message }). This ensures that only users in that room receive the message.

    Receiving Messages:
        On the client side, users listen for "newMessage" events and display the received message. Each user should only listen for messages in the chat room they are currently in.

These changes ensure that messages are properly isolated to the correct chat rooms and are not visible in other rooms.

what was wrong in my given code

In your given code, the issue was that messages were being broadcasted to all users, regardless of which chat room they were in. This resulted in messages from one chat room being visible to users in other chat rooms. To fix this, it was necessary to ensure that messages were only broadcasted to users in the specific chat room where the message was sent. This was achieved by using io.to(roomId).emit() instead of socket.broadcast.emit() to ensure that messages are only sent to users in the specified room.

   socket.on("chatRoom", ({ chatID }) => {
        socket.join(chatID)
        socket.on("send", ({ message, id }) => {
            console.log("hello", message)
            socket.broadcast.to(id).emit("newMessage", { message })
        })

here also i have used socket.broadcast.to(id).emit 

whats wrong here
ChatGPT

The issue in your code is that you're using socket.broadcast.to(id).emit("newMessage", { message }) to send the message to the user in the specified chat room. However, socket.broadcast will send the message to all clients except the sender, and using to(id) specifies a specific socket to exclude. This means that the message will be sent to all sockets except the one specified by id, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this issue, you should use io.to(chatID).emit("newMessage", { message }) instead. This will ensure that the message is sent to all sockets in the specified chat room (chatID).
